# 💼 FinanceAI — Open Banking Personal Finance Intelligence System

AI-powered personal finance dashboard inspired by UK Open Banking, built using Streamlit, ML, and time-series forecasting to deliver intelligent financial insights.

FinanceAI is a smart money assistant that looks at your bank transactions and helps you understand where your money goes, what bills are coming next, and whether you are likely to run out of money in the future.

Example: If you earn £2,000 a month and spend too much on food and subscriptions, FinanceAI can warn you that your balance may drop below £200 next month, future transactions and suggest saving or cutting unused subscriptions

## 🧠 AI & Intelligence Logic

### Merchant Normalization
Cleans raw bank descriptions:
- Example: `TESCO STORES 1294` → `Tesco`
- Example: `APPLE.COM/BILL LONDON` → `Apple Services`

### Brand Mapping
- Maps merchants to canonical brands
- Enables subscription & recurring detection

### Recurring Transaction Detection
Uses:
- Date interval consistency
- Amount stability
- Frequency patterns

### Confidence Scoring
- **High** → Very likely to recur
- **Medium** → Probable recurrence
- **Low** → Weak or noisy pattern

### Balance Forecasting
- ARIMA time-series model
- Logistic Regression
- Fallback average-trend logic
- Date-range–dependent accuracy

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Forecast Sensitivity
- Forecasts change significantly with date range
- More history → more stable predictions

### Scope
- UI & intelligence focused
- No real Open Banking APIs (yet)

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

- Multi-bank selection
- Real Open Banking API integration
- Authentication & user profiles
- Category prediction ML model
- PDF export of insights
- Cloud deployment

For future enhancements we can use BERT / FinBERT for transaction understanding, LSTM(RNN) and XGBoost regressor for forecasting, DBSCAN / HDBSCAN & HMM for Recurring Payments & Subscriptions and few more
